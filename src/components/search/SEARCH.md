## Coin Search Component

### Overview
This React component (`Search`) is designed to facilitate the search and display of cryptocurrency information using the CoinGecko API. It provides a simple search functionality and displays information about coins, including their images, names, and IDs.

### Dependencies
- React (specifically `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` hooks)

### File Structure
- The component is encapsulated in a file named `Search.js`.

### Hooks
#### `useState`
- `coins`: State variable to hold the current list of coins.
- `trending`: State variable to store the trending coins.
  
#### `useRef`
- `coinSearch`: Ref to store the reference of the input field for coin search.

#### `useEffect`
- Fetches and sets the trending coins when the component mounts.

### Functions
#### `getTrendingCoins()`
- Fetches trending coins from the CoinGecko API.
- Maps the response data to extract relevant information (image, name, id).
- Sets both `trending` and `coins` state variables.

#### `handleClick()`
- Handles the search button click event.
- Retrieves the query from the input field.
- If a query is present, fetches and sets the coins based on the search query.
- If no query is present, sets the coins to the trending coins.

### Rendered Components
- A form with an input field and a search button.
- A list of coins with their images, names, and a placeholder for additional information.

### Styling
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, with specific classes for input, button, and coin list elements.

   ```javascript
   import Search from './Search';
   ```
2. Include the `Search` component in your JSX code.
   ```javascript
   <Search />

### Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`react`, `react-dom`, etc.).
